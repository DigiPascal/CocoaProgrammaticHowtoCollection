This shows how to create an Cocoa GUI app using only program code with no Interface Builder stuffs.
Apple sample codes are great, but in many cases it lacks programmatic-only way.

It's arguable that which one of IB-ful or IB-less strategy is better. But it's also clear that the IB
sometimes doesn't fit to, work on or serve well some situations. This how-to examples are written for 
the situations.



This also contains some non-GUI stuffs lacked in Apple's documentation. 
For example, *Umbrella framework*.



These examples always aims the minimal code and configuration, then what you see is all fully required
to do the job.
